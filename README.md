# 2.2 Skate Shop

This project we were tasked to create a replica of a mock by a designer and used Bootstrap, media queries, SASS and more to complete the project.



### Tech Used

During the development of this project I used the following technology:


* [HTML5] - latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages
* [CSS3] - latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
